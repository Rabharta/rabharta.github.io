**Democracy**

We are committed to pluralist and open discussion, which underpins collective decision-making, ownership, and responsibility.
       

**Equality and Equity**

We recognise the rights and freedoms of every person, regardless of where they live or who they are.
      

**Collective Liberation**

Our struggles are interconnected. They require an intersectional, anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist movement that is rooted in class politics and leverages state power.


**Ecology**

People are a part of nature, we need to restore and recognise that interconnectedness and end biodiversity loss through habitat destruction and degradation. 
      

**Solidarity**

We promote systems of connection and support within our organisation and in our local communities, as well as at the national and international levels.
      

**Cooperation**

We are committed to non-hierarchical and partnership approaches in our political activism.
