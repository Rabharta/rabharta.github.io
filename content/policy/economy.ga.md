**An Economy that Invests in Communities & People**
The economy of the future is one that is one that is owned by the people. A Green New Deal and National Investment bank will be the foundation of a green, local economy that refocuses on health and wellbeing over profit.

**Tax Capital, not Labour**
Raising and spending of taxes to be taken at a more local level.
A fundamental rebalancing of public finances to shift the burden from working people to polluters, wealthy tax-avoiders and unearned income.

**A community-focused, recalibrated public service**
Robust local and nationally owned civic institutions. Public ownership of natural resources, and universal services.

**Post-growth Economics and Community Wealth Building**
Establishing worker-cooperatives, community energy schemes and local circular economies to break the cycle of extractive GDP based growth.

**Global Tax Justice**
Restore Irelandâ€™s reputation as a force for economic justice in the international arena.
