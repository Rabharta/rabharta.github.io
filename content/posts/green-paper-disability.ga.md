Below is a submission on the Green Paper on Disability Reform from _Rabharta — The Party for Workers and Carers_. Our submission was compiled by a working group of people with lived experience of disability, carers and people without disability. We also had external input from people with disabilities. The submission was agreed by the wider party membership prior to finalising.

**Foreword**

A discussion on reform for disability social support is welcomed. The current system has a large number of issues; the supports are insufficient and there are inconsistencies between existing schemes. We do not, however, agree with the proposals in this Green Paper. Although the stated aspirations of developing a system that moves away from a system that “assesses people in a one-size-fits-all way” is commendable, there is little in this Green Paper to back up this intention in a serious way.

Our main disagreements with this Green Paper are:

- The lack of inclusion of people with disability in the development of this plan, which has led to a paternalistic and ableist proposal. This contravenes Article 4 of the UNCRPD by not having consulted with people with lived experiences in developing it.
- There is no mention of the UNCRPD in the Green Paper. Any policy relating to people with disability should be rooted in the UNCRPD.
- The underpinning sentiment of the Green Paper to “Encourage and support the take-up of work by people with disabilities who have the capacity to work” perpetuates the harmful idea that people with disabilities do not want to work. It blames people with disabilities for not working, rather than examining and acknowledging the systemic barriers that force them into unemployment.
- The proposed amounts of support are insufficient to prevent poverty in recipients. In particular, they do not address the additional costs of disability.
- The proposed tiered approach contravenes best practice for supporting people with disabilities; three groupings is little better than a single catch-all. We advocate for an individualised and person-centred approach that takes account of the many and varied complexities that exist as a part of a person’s experience with disability.
- The assessment for eligibility is overly medicalised and does not consider the wider social aspects of having a disability.
- The Green Paper sets out to include “new measures to improve employment outcomes”. Other than forcing people to engage with Intreo, there are no measures to improve employment outcomes in this proposal. Employment supports cannot be dealt with separately, they are intrinsically intertwined with welfare payments.
- A significant omission in this Green Paper is a focus on wider wellbeing. People with disabilities are not merely economic units to be pressured into producing for the economy. They are people with hopes and dreams and family and friends, and should be supported in a much wider sense than during only the hours within which they ‘ought to’ be working.

We have synthesised our detailed feedback under the themes of, public consultation process, context for change and focus of the Green Paper, tiered approach, in-work income supports and eligibility for payments. We outline our disagreements with the Green Paper but also offer alternatives and highlight considerations.

**Public consultation process**

We acknowledge the effort in developing an easy read version, ISL version and braille version of the Green Paper. However, these efforts fall short of what is needed to engage properly with people with disabilities.

A one-page summary, an infographic, a video summary, and other similar resources should have been developed. These should have been developed in conjunction with people with disabilities in order to ensure their appropriateness. A structured survey that breaks down the questions in the Green Paper into bite-sized chunks and a facility for submitting an oral submission should also have been made available. Without such resources, this public engagement is performative. We also note that the consultation period was first extended in response to external pressure, in what was again a purely performative action, as no further information or in person consultation events were scheduled to take account of the extension. The second extension, makes little sense, has led to confusion and was at such short notice that it is of little benefit to people.

Budgetary or resource limitations as an excuse for not providing the above, is not an excuse. That just speaks to poor project planning and a distinct lack of understanding of the cohort of people that this Green Paper presumes to aid. It begs the questions as to the suitability of those involved in the development of this Green Paper to propose a system for people with disabilities, people that they clearly do not understand.

There is a fundamental philosophy in the world of disability of “nothing for us without us” or “with us, not for us”. The voice of people with disabilities should have been at the centre of this work, but clearly was not. People with disabilities should be co-authors rather than consultants. Ultimately, people with disabilities know best what will work for them. To construct any relevant policy without this value at its core is, quite frankly, both paternalistic and insulting.

[Article 4 of the UNCRPD](https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/article-4-general-obligations.html#:~:text=1.,on%20the%20basis%20of%20disability) is about consulting with people with lived experiences and representative groups in the development and implementation of legislation and policies to implement the Convention, and in other decision-making processes concerning issues relating to persons with disabilities. There is no evidence of this having been done in the development of the Green Paper. Not only is the Green Paper in contravention of this article, there is no mention of the UNCRPD anywhere in the document. The Green Paper needs to be rooted in the Convention. We strongly advocate for a complete revision that starts with the Convention and uses a rights based approach to develop reform of disability allowances.

The lack of engagement prior to the publication of the Green Paper and the lack of proper clarification as to the purpose of a Green Paper has upset many people with disabilities. It has been perceived as a fait accompli by many and has been deeply unsettling for some of the most vulnerable members of our society, instigating fear that they may lose benefits or be compelled to find work at any cost. We find this to be deeply inconsiderate and ableist. People with disabilities have also expressed fears in submitting responses to the green paper in case their writings will be used as evidence against them, to tier them on a lower tier and force them into work that they are not able for. This fear is a very understandable one and should have been thought about in developing the submissions process and work done to ensure that people’s anonymity was protected and provide assurances that any feedback provided would not be used against them.

People with disabilities are understandably nervous about engaging with the Green Paper due to a fear of retaliation. As a result, feedback on the Green Paper is likely to mostly come from advocacy groups and carers. While these groups play an enormously important role, they are not the people with disabilities directly impacted, and as such, their voices alone are insufficient.

**Context for change and the focus of this Green Paper**

Section 2 of the Green Paper “Context for change and focus of this Green Paper” highlights, correctly, a number of issues faced by people with disabilities. We agree that:

- There is an increasing prevalence of disability in Ireland.
- Employment rates for disabled people in Ireland are lower than in other countries.
- Poverty and deprivation rates for people with disabilities are significantly higher than for the general population.
- People with disabilities face higher costs than non-disabled people, and these costs vary depending on a range of factors, including the nature of their disability.

However, there are a few glaring omissions in the analysis in this Green Paper. It was not noted that there are also lower levels of educational attainment and higher levels of mental health illness and health concerns (not directly associated with their disability). Additionally, people with disabilities face increased social exclusion, transportation barriers, communication barriers, physical barriers, policy barriers and attitudinal barriers.

It is our belief that examining employment and poverty while ignoring these challenges is not appropriate. We call for a more holistic approach to the development of a new disability support scheme; one which respects and supports people with disabilities. We appreciate that there are departmental divisions of responsibility but this is too important and a cross-departmental approach would be more appropriate for this work.

The Green Paper sets out to include “new measures to improve employment outcomes”. Other than forcing people to engage with Intreo (which is wholly-inappropriate, something we address in detail further down in our submission), there are no other measures to improve employment outcomes in this proposal. Employment supports cannot be dealt with separately, they are intrinsically intertwined with welfare payments. We call for this to be addressed and focused on.

Employment supports to be considered include:

- Provide free travel passes for everyone with a disability, regardless of their level of disability or whether they have been in receipt of a disability payment.
- Increase and expand the Employability Services, which are provided by companies working on behalf of Intreo, to include dedicated social welfare staff trained in, for example, occupational therapy or mental health, in order to support people with disabilities in finding and staying in work. A personal approach, with an option of in person or remote meetings, accessible building/communications, sign language skills, and audio loop provision is essential. Staff must also be local to the area, as there is a need for local knowledge of barriers to employment such as detailed knowledge of transport options.
- Offer remote work as a fundamental right, rather than merely the ‘right to request to work remotely’. This supports people with disabilities, in particular disabilities that involve fatigue or anxiety, and physical disabilities. We believe that this should not be limited to people with disabilities as it would benefit other groups in society too.
- Provide more training centres for people with disabilities.
- Increase third-level education support for people with disabilities.
- Increase the carers allowance to at least match the [poverty threshold of €301.92](https://www.socialjustice.ie/article/poverty-ireland#:~:text=In%202023%20that%20figure%20is,income%20per%20adult%20equivalent%20figure).
- Increase funding for accessibility aids including technological aids. Access to technological aids can make an enormous difference to the life of a person with disability and can be the difference between being able to work and not work, but also, more importantly, can facilitate being able to actively and wholly participate in society.
- Promote and incentivise different types of employment contracts e.g. flexi-time contracts with safeguards. There is a place for flexi-time contracts in supporting people with disabilities as they support them in selecting the amount of hours they can work in a given week, depending on their health in that week.
- Create a national system of supports for supporting disabled people in being self-employed should they wish to be.

The framing of this statement “Encourage and support the take-up of work by people with disabilities who have the capacity to work” and the wider document, are not appropriate. It perpetuates the harmful and insulting idea that people with disabilities do not want to work. It blames people with disabilities for not working, rather than examining and acknowledging the systemic barriers that force them into unemployment. Most people with disabilities really want to work. A large part of the trauma that comes after being diagnosed or being injured is the loss of independence and the fear of not being able to support oneself financially in the future. The lack of acknowledgement of this reality in this Green Paper is completely reprehensible. It assumes that people with disabilities can individually overcome oppression and discrimination in the workforce and denies that these are real barriers to their employment. It also places the blame for the high unemployment rates of people with disabilities squarely on the shoulders of people with disabilities and does not apportion any blame for the situation on employers or the state.

We agree that there is a need for reform of disability payments and that there are inconsistencies between existing schemes. The intention outlined in the Green Paper to move away from a system that “assesses people in a one-size-fits-all way” is commendable, however, there is little in this Green Paper to back up these good intentions in a serious way. A three-tiered system is ultimately much the same as a one-size-fits-all. Instead, we advocate for a person-centred approach with vastly more individualised payments. We expand on this later in this submission.

---

**Tiered approach and In-work income supports**

We have commented on Sections 4 (tiered approach — defining, assessing, and assigning) and 5 (In-work income supports) together as they are intrinsically intertwined.

We agree that replacing the Disability Allowance, Blind Pension and Invalidity pension with a single scheme is necessary and timely. We do not however agree with the proposed scheme.

We believe that a tiered approach contravenes best practice for supporting people with disabilities; three groupings is little better than a single catch-all. The varying amounts of allowance based on tiers (Level 1: High support — Very low capacity to work, Level 2: Medium support — Low to moderate capacity to work, Level 3: Low support — Moderate to high capacity to work) conflates two issues, disability related costs and capacity to work. The Green Paper assumes that people with the highest extra cost of disability are those with the lowest capacity to work. This is incorrect. Instead, we advocate for an individualised and person-centred approach that takes account of the many and varied complexities that exist as a part of a person’s experience with disability.

We recommend consideration of a points-based approach that offers people with disabilities a personalised payment depending on whether or not they fulfil a wide and varied array of criteria. In such an approach, every person with a disability would, as a base, receive the same universal payment. This would then be topped up by a specified amount based on the total number of ‘points’ that they are assigned. A non-exhaustive list of factors that could be included are:

- Distance from nearest public transport stop
- Access to a car with ability to drive
- Access to free healthcare
- Determination of physical incapacity
- Determination of mental distress/incapacity
- Level of social deprivation in the area
- Level of housing supports available
- Level of additional food-related supports required

Importantly, these points would add up to a total payment that is additive to the universal base payment that all people with disabilities would get. This would provide a much more individualised and granular approach to assessing an individual’s needs rather than the system proposed in the Green Paper. It would also reduce dependence on an overly medicalised and somewhat arbitrary approach to assessing a person’s financial support needs

An individualised approach where people are in receipt of different payment amounts would also alleviate the concern expressed by some that the amount of disability allowance that they receive would disclose too much about their disability. For example, under the tiered model, a person collecting their payment at a post office would be easily identifiable as having a disability with a high, medium or low level of support needs. This contravenes their right to privacy in health-related matters.

Regarding the levels of payment, we believe that the current level of support actively punishes people with disabilities. At the bare minimum, people with disabilities should be able to live a life free of poverty and social deprivation. Under internationally-agreed criteria, a household is stated to be in relative poverty if their income falls below 60% of the median household income. This amount required to escape relative poverty in Ireland is €301.92 per week. The aim of any government that has people with disabilities’ best interests at heart should be to reach this figure in order to support the autonomy and independence of people with disabilities.

Not even trying to reach this figure supposes that it is expected that people with disability live in a two adult household and that their partners will support them financially. We should not create a scheme that makes people with disability dependent on their partners.

There is an obvious assumption in the mathematics behind this plan that people with disabilities don’t or can’t live alone. In reality, many people with disabilities do live alone. This should not be confused with the concept of people with disabilities living independently. Here, we are talking about single people with disability who do live independently but who have not found or choose not to have a partner. People with disability are less likely to be in durable relationships and could be reliant wholly on their disability payment to support their household.

The proposed rates (€220, €242.65, and €265.30) fall far short of the estimates needed to escape relative poverty. This condemns many people with disabilities to a life of poverty due to their disability. With both the current supports and the proposed supports, the government is ultimately condemning these people to poverty.

Furthermore, the relative poverty estimate assumes that everyone has an equal cost of living when considering basics and essentials. In the case of people with disabilities, we know that this is not true. While the Green Paper goes into detail on the various additional costs that many people with disabilities face, it fails to adequately ameliorate said additional costs with any of the three rigid tiers of personal support payments. The individualised points based system that we proposed above would address this issue in a granular and person-centred way. We are not the first to propose a system like this. In 1996, the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that there should be “a graduated payment to meet the additional everyday costs associated with disability. This payment, which would be made irrespective of whether the person is at work or not, would be called the ‘Costs of Disability Payment’”.

This Green Paper is underpinned with ableist thinking and lack of understanding of the concept of equity. It positions people with disability as inherently dependent and burdensome, and doesn’t acknowledge that people with disabilities have all of the same life and family goals as people without disabilities. We should be developing a support scheme that enables people with disabilities to have relationships and children and live their lives to the fullest.

The concept that your meagre disability payment would be reduced or even lost entirely if you were to enter a relationship is another failing. It creates another barrier for people trying to find a partner. As if having a disability isn’t enough of a barrier, this set up means for someone to enter a relationship with a person with disabilities, they can be taking on both their care and their financial needs. And for the person with disabilities, it means losing their financial independence. We propose introducing a universal payment for people with disabilities and removing the means testing entirely.

Another point worth consideration with regard to payment amounts is that low disability payments force people to stay in full time work when it would be better for their health to work less. Low disability payments can as such be a direct contributor to increased disability over time. It begs the question as to the sense behind under-supporting people to such a degree that they then end up costing more to support in the long run due to deteriorating health.

Regarding the assessment criteria, we believe it to be highly-invasive and disrespectful to require a specific physical assessment in order to ‘prove’ disability and eligibility. Other legislation has moved away from invasive physical assessment criteria. Almost 10 years ago, in September 2015, the Dáil overwhelmingly passed the Gender Recognition Act, which removed the requirement for invasive physical assessments for trans people to alter their identified gender; imagine a person who is both transgender and has a disability, having to doubly prove their worthiness to receive state assistance? Ideally, the person’s medical records should, with the consent of the person themselves, be made available to the assessor in order to help them to better tailor support, while at all stages working with the person with disabilities.

We also note that the assessment is entirely medicalised and does not reach into the wider social aspects of having a disability. A person’s ability to socialise can be impacted by disability. It can be, in and of itself, a reason why someone can’t engage with the work environment. Determining that someone is physically (by reason of an enduring physical, sensory, mental health or intellectual impairment) capable of work is not the same as determining that someone is capable of working.

**Eligibility for long-term disability payments**

The Green Paper proposes to continue to apply the current number of social insurance contributions and means test income limits for those who cannot work due to their disability.

We do not agree with this. We call instead for a universal payment that is not means tested.

Carrying across vestibules of the current system will continue to fail to acknowledge the group of people with disabilities who continue to work in their role after being diagnosed or injured. This group of people have higher costs and needs than their peers without disabilities. If a person manages to stay in work, despite the difficulties their disability presents, they are not considered “disabled enough” to qualify for any of the social welfare support they most likely need to continue to manage their disability and live well. This cohort needs supports in order to prevent or delay them from becoming wholly dependent on welfare payments. Supports for this cohort could include:

- Paid disability leave days: These would be extra days leave similar to schemes such as [the domestic violence leave in Ireland](https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/employment-rights-and-conditions/leave-and-holidays/domestic-violence-leave/) or [the menstrual leave in Spain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/02/17/spain-paid-menstrual-leave-countries/). These days would be for rest and recuperation, and not aimed at covering time off for medical appointments.
- Free travel pass: Currently, if a person moves off disability allowance to a job, they can keep their free travel pass for five years. As such, we have two groups with similar needs being treated differently. Both the group who stayed in work and the group that were temporarily forced out of work, are now working. We shouldn’t penalise people with disability who manage to stay in work without state aid. Furthermore, five years is arbitrary and assumes that they will in some way recover from their disability when many disabilities are life-long and can be progressive.
- Paid time off from work for medical appointments: This should be a right offered to everyone, as, while people with disabilities are disproportionately penalised by the lack of provision of paid time off for medical appointments due to their higher number of appointments when compared to the general population, everyone is currently discouraged from accessing necessary healthcare due to this.
- An increase in “allowable means” for other social welfare payments for those with disabilities to acknowledge the higher living costs they incur. For example, in the free GP visit scheme.

We agree with the proposed change to align the age at which Disability Allowance is payable to that of other working age payments, i.e. 18 years. We consider that this will support youths with disabilities in staying in education longer and increase their employment ability, sense of achievement, socialisation, and reduce the perception that people with disabilities are different to their peers. The inclusion of “access to the contributory disability income support” at 18 years is however a contradiction. If the aim is to support youths remaining in school, then they can’t have had employment that would have led to sufficient PRSI contributions. This needs to be reflected on and worded more carefully.

The plan for transitional payments is welcomed. This aspect of the proposal thankfully appears to be person-centred. We would welcome more person-centred approaches in other aspects of this reform.

The included text in the Green Paper, “children with certain disabilities do not always have financial skills [to manage their payments]”, is offensive and is contrary to the principles of a human rights based approach to care, specifically, autonomy. Assuming that someone does not have capacity or even when someone does in fact not have capacity, it is not a reason to withhold a payment. People with disabilities without the financial skills to manage their money should be given additional supports to manage their money, rather than them being penalised by payments being withheld or their payments going to someone else by default. Imagine the comparable scenario of withholding a pension payment to an older person with reduced capacity due to dementia. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 has established a legal framework for supported decision-making in Ireland. It allows people to make legal agreements on how they can be supported to make decisions about their personal welfare, property and affairs. This framework should have been accounted for in the thinking behind this statement.

Given that the NEET (not in employment, education or training) rate of young people with disabilities is 23%, more than twice the rate of young people without a disability at 10%, in making this move to commencing payment of disability allowance to age 18 years, actions to address this gap need to be prioritised. We appreciate the scope of this Green Paper is financial support payments for people with disabilities; however, examining payments in isolation and not addressing non-financial supports for the same cohort is short-sighted. Siloed thinking will not solve wicked problems. Supports for this cohort could include, for example:

- Higher numbers of special needs assistants in schools.
- Greater community based occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, counsellors and community nurses.
- Provision of home tutors.
- Increased funding for supportive technology in schools.
- Wellbeing supports.
- Promotion of the Leaving Certification Applied route.
- Expansion of access programmes to third level education for people with disabilities.
- Increase in the number of third level courses tailored for people with intellectual disability.

There is a glaring gap in this change of age payable plan, as it does not acknowledge the costs of having a disability. Domiciliary care allowance is only for children with severe disabilities. The high costs associated with supporting a child with a less severe disability to remain in education such as transport, caring responsibilities of a parent that precludes them from working, medical costs, costs of tutors and purchase of aids, are not accounted for. In this context. We are talking about families that don’t qualify for social welfare supports and take on the extra financial burden themselves. This is a similar gap in supports to that which we highlighted earlier (people with disabilities that stay in work and don’t qualify for supports but still have higher needs and costs). This cohort could be supported by:

- Free travel pass
- An increase in allowable means for other social welfare payments for those with disabilities to acknowledge the higher living costs they incur.

**Further comments**

The Green Paper seems to be striving for equality within the disability supports schemes. We caution that this is shortsighted — we should be striving for equity instead. Equality is about providing the same to all, equity is about recognising that we do not all start from the same place and acknowledges and makes adjustments for these imbalances. Given the very varied ways in which disabilities impact on people and the wide array of needs people with disabilities have, any support system should be designed with equity in mind, first and foremost.

This proposal appears to be based somewhat on the UK system, which is a known failure.

We recommend looking to the Scottish system and plans for an example of a system with dignity, fairness and respect at its heart. The Scottish system is based on human rights principles and is designed, with the people of Scotland, on the basis of evidence.

A significant omission in this Green Paper is a focus on wider wellbeing. People with disabilities are not merely economic units to be pressured into producing for the economy; they are people with hopes and dreams and family and friends, and should be supported in a much wider sense than during only the hours within which they ‘ought to’ be working. We believe that there must be a much wider discussion on how the State can support people with disabilities to thrive throughout all of their time, and how everything can be adjusted to improve accessibility and equity.

There is a lack of regard to the barriers to employment faced by people with disabilities, evident in this Green Paper. Such barriers include transport, the built environment, availability of suitable jobs and discrimination. These are system level barriers and cannot be overcome by an individual. System level change is needed and needs to be brought forward for wider discussion and input.

The proposal that people with disabilities on Tier 3 (moderate to high capacity to work) in the new scheme would be required to engage with Intreo and take up training opportunities and job offers, is very poorly thought through. Firstly, using Intreo as the employment support centre for people with disabilities is not appropriate. People with disabilities need a different format of support to engage with employment, one that is more based in occupational health, mental health and technological supports rather than in training and being advised of job openings. The “Employability Services”, which are provided by companies working on behalf of Intreo, is little better, a solution. This proposal shows little regard for the independence of people with disabilities. It is disrespectful to assume the level of capability of an individual based on their disabilities. The two are independent. Take the situation of a highly qualified professional who is injured and ceases their previous employment. Forcing them to engage with Intreo would be of no benefit to them, a drain on resources, an extra burden on the person with disabilities and all so that they can receive a paltry amount of state assistance during what may be the worst period of their life. Providing them with tailored supports such as mobility aids, technological assists and personal carer would be a much better pathway to supporting this type of individual in returning to work.

In this submission, we advocate for a personalised approach based on a universal base support plus add-ons using a points based system. We also think there is a need to expand this and provide universal income support in Ireland so as not to create a separate group of people with disabilities. Furthermore, we caution that if a points based system were to be introduced for people with disabilities, it must not be a deduction based system and should be, base plus additions based on criteria.

Carers allowance is not addressed in this Green Paper, other than Domiciliary Care Allowance. We feel it is short sighted to examine disability and carers allowances separately. Carers are the invisible support structure for people with disabilities. This Green Paper proposal would exacerbate the existing paradox of a person with disabilities entering employment but their family based carer still needs to care for them. Their carer can’t work outside of their care responsibilities so cannot earn or get carers allowance as the household income (from the now employed person with disabilities), makes them ineligible. It also doesn’t account for the fact that people with disabilities can also be carers. If this Green Paper proposal were progressed, some people could find themselves in the position of being classed as tier 3 and therefore required to take up employment, when their partner, classed as tier 1, is then left without a carer. The unsaid aim of this Green Paper appears to be to create more economic units. The easiest way to do that is to support carers properly and disentangle their payments from the household income by removing means testing both for allowances for people with disabilities and carers. Anywhere that care is provided is a workplace and carers should be remunerated accordingly.

The non-existent consideration of the increased costs of living with a disability in this Green Paper is ableist and we have outlined our disagreement with this above. A related point to this is that this proposal would not have any benefit to people with disability-related costs who do not receive a disability payment, for example people on the state pension and, as we highlighted above, people who continue to work. Another related point is the current housing crisis, particularly rental, which is disproportionately impacting people with disabilities. Their housing needs can be more complicated, limiting the availability of suitable properties, thus increasing their costs further. There is no consideration for housing costs in this Green Paper.

We question why this Green Paper was advanced while the Personalised Budget Pilot is still in progress and evaluation not due until Q2 of this year. It appears very disjointed to not include learnings from a pilot scheme designed to evaluate a method of payment support for people with disabilities. It appears that two Departments (Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth) within the Government are working at cross purposes.

This Green Paper sets out to address two specific aims:

- to encourage a higher level of employment for people with disabilities, which will enhance their participation in society and reduce the risk of poverty and deprivation.
- to better insulate (protect) disabled people who cannot work from poverty and deprivation.

It is our opinion that neither of these aims would be achieved by this Green Paper proposal. We strongly encourage a return to the drawing board and the involvement of people with disabilities in the drafting of a new proposal. One that is person-centred, rights based and equitable.
