Article 41.2, “The Care Amendment”. There has been long standing consensus that the current wording of Article 41.2 referring to a woman’s life within the home, is outdated and sexist. This referendum should have been the opportunity to simply replace “woman” with gender neutral language, but the government has chosen not to do so. Instead, they have proposed removing Article 41.2 and replacing it with Article 42.B which recognises the provision of care by members of the family and says that the state will strive to support such provision.

This new Article places the responsibility for care on families and fails to recognise care outside of families. Care should not be treated as a private matter. Care should be a competence of the state. Whether symbolic or otherwise, this expectation of care being provided by family members should not be enshrined in our constitution.

Like the Repeal the 8th campaign, this referendum has resulted in people affected by the proposed change having to share their personal stories just to be acknowledged and listened to. Through these stories we gain insight to the constant discrimination faced by people with disabilities and carers. People who have often had to take legal action against the state for the provision of basics such as school places and access to transport. People with disabilities and carers should not have to beg for basic rights and services.

[The recent declaration that a No vote would be a protest vote](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2024/02/26/una-mullally-an-anti-government-protest-vote-in-the-referendums-would-be-a-mistake/), is disingenuous and lacks understanding of the issues at play. There are people that believe that the current wording should be removed or replaced but are opposed to the Care Amendment on the grounds that it is discriminatory and paternalistic. These people are screaming from the rooftops for progressive change.

The biggest failing of this referendum is that the people that it impacts have not been listened to. A Citizen’s Assembly was convened but their recommendations were not translated into the wording of the referendums. The Government has not listened to the people they are representing. 22% of people in our country reported in the last Census as having a disability, and 6% reported as providing regular unpaid care. This isn’t a small cohort of people.

Almost all the political parties and many advocacy groups are supporting a Yes vote to the Care Amendment. Those who are supporting a Yes vote are not listening to the concerns of people with disabilities and carers. Sinn Féin, largely considered the government in waiting, have committed to running another referendum and putting forward more progressive wording if there is a No vote. This commitment has been welcomed but why then are they campaigning for a Yes vote?

There are groups such as FLAC and IHREC who are not supporting a Yes vote. FLAC has expressed my concern with the Care Amendment very eloquently: This is a “constitutional expression of a harmful stereotype of people with disabilities as the subject of family care rather than autonomous individuals and rights holders”.

Just because I live with a disability, does not mean I am not autonomous. I am a carer. I am the breadwinner in the household. I am a mother. My children and partner should not be burdened with my care. No mother would wish their care on their child, particularly not when their need for care, as it is in my case, comes ahead of time. This amendment effectively says that the state will strive to support our children becoming our carers. We’re supposed to care for our children, not the other way around.

People with disabilities face challenges and discrimination constantly, based on rights violations and lack of basic services and supports. Basic supports should not be something the government will “strive” to provide. They should be of paramount importance and in line with the UNCRPD. People with disabilities and carers are saying they are tired of having to beg for things that others in society take for granted. We should have been listened to a long time ago and must be listened to now.

People may be reading the literature on the Care Amendment in a slightly abstract manner, as if it doesn’t really affect them. As a person who only joined the disabled community in recent years having been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2021 at the age of 35, I would like to point out that humans are all pre disabled. Disability will come for almost everyone at some point, be it through illness, injury or advancing age. We will all need care. This amendment isn’t about the people with disabilities who are so often forgotten or dismissed. It is about everyone. Why aren’t people listening to those who already have a disability? We are offering the gift of foresight.

<mark>People with disabilities don’t have demands in this referendum, we have rights that need to be afforded and upheld.</mark> The Constitution currently reflects an archaic view of family, care and many other things. Amending it to directly grant people rights, supports or status would be welcome. However, there is no evidence to support the idea that the proposed amendment will have any downstream material benefit for people with disabilities or carers. It is window dressing that erodes the status of people with disabilities in the name of a progressive gesture. The wording is the product of a top-down, paternalistic approach that has failed to listen to the voices of the people that it impacts.

Although I am a No vote for the Care Amendment, I am a Yes vote for the Family Amendment. The proposed change includes durable relationships alongside marriage as the definition of family and removes the words “on which the family is founded”, meaning that family can no longer be considered exclusively as families with married partners. As my partner and I indiscriminately referee, feed, hug and generally cajole our band of scallywags through life, no one looking at us would think we were anything other than family, yet, our constitution does not, as of now, recognise us as such. Although expanding the definition of a family in the amendment is largely amenable to people, the concept of what constitutes a durable relationship, has been questioned. There is however no specific definition. It will be up to the courts to decide. It could include partners who are not married or in a civil partnership, but who are nonetheless in a committed relationship. It is not an untested concept. It is used in the EU settlement scheme, the EU Citizen’s Rights Directive, there is also a similar term “de facto family” used in the European Convention on Human Rights.

We need a Yes No vote on the 8th of March and to have another referendum with better wording on the Care Amendment soon. Political change does not flow from constitutional change, it works the other way around. As such, we also need relevant political platforms and vehicles such as my party, Rabharta — The Party for Workers and Carers, to address the broken system that people with disabilities are forced to live in. People with disabilities have a right to live in their communities, enabled and supported.
