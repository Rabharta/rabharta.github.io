My name is Cllr Lorna Bogue and I am the leader of Rabharta: The Party For Workers and Carers. It feels good to say that, because we’ve spent the last couple of years defining our party’s purpose. And to me that purpose is very clear. Workers and carers do not have political representation or power in the political system, in the economy, in workplaces, communities or even homes. Our objective as a party is to be a catalyst for mass representation of workers and carers.

Currently, the idea of an economy under democratic control — which prioritises the well-being of the population over market performance — is so unimaginable to most people in Ireland that none of the major political parties have ever dared to propose it in their election manifestos. We want to change that. Because if it is to survive the coming decades, our economy needs to be restructured along democratic principles.

The attitude that informs the mother and baby homes redress scheme is the same as that which informed the referendum on care. The results show that people are not tolerating this approach any more. A transition, Green or otherwise, for elites alone is not one that in our view addresses the Climate problem. The political system, workplaces, communities and homes need to be democratised. Without this there is no transition to a post-carbon world, or to a more socially just economy and society. This is the core business of representatives of our party, and we think that it is in places like Limerick that the type of restructuring that prioritises workers and carers can take root. For the type of agency required to bring about this restructuring is not only possible, but here with us today.

I am a councillor with Cork city council and I think that it is possible for councils as anchor institutions to have a huge role in democratising our economy. The new role of a directly elected mayor should have had this goal, but the government sees it more as a gimmick than something serious. We see it as a serious opening for a new kind of politics. We are running a candidate in this election to win, and because the person elected will be the first person in this role, a solid candidate is needed to redefine the role for future generations.

As a Limerick person myself, this is personal! I want this mayoral role to work for the people of Limerick. I don’t want this opportunity to be squandered on a voice for the establishment. I want somebody strong, qualified and compassionate. To this end, I can think of nobody better than Dr Laura Keyes to do it. Laura is a hugely impressive candidate, and a comrade who has educated and enlightened our party as to the realities of life for people with disabilities and to hugely important aspects of public health.

Members of the public and party members. A chomrádaí. I am delighted to officially launch the campaign of Dr Laura Keyes for Directly Elected Mayor of Limerick City and County.

This is a very exciting opportunity for Limerick to have somebody in a top role in council who will really champion Limerick as a place for workers and carers. Across Europe directly elected mayors are powerful actors for local government. Limerick needs someone who will really champion accessibility, health and social care services, transport and infrastructural development nationally and internationally for everyone in the county.

It also needs a person who can engage with and represent the interests of the workers and carers to whom Limerick belongs.

Dr Laura Keyes is all of these things and I am looking forward to campaigning alongside her.

**Speaker: Dr Laura Keyes, Candidate for Directly Elected Mayor, Limerick**

`[STARTS]`

I am very pleased to be announcing my candidacy in the mayoral election for Limerick, and I want to thank the party for its support.

This mayoral election is an opportunity to make a bold statement about the type of city, county and country that we want to bring about. The powerful in this country never intended to give us a mayoral position that would open possibilities for workers and carers in Limerick. And because we’re so used to the status quo it can be hard to imagine the possibilities.

So, what are they?

Simple things. Like living locally to your work and family and not worrying about sky-high rents or being evicted. Not having to pay for private transport and health insurance to avoid unreliable public routes or long medical waiting lists. Or the possibility of feeling like your voice is heard and matters in public debates.

Our city and county could be built so that the currently marginalised flourish and thrive, rather than simply to generate the profit of property developers and landlords.

I know Limerick. I have witnessed her triumphs and challenges firsthand. I have seen the strengths of our communities, the resilience of our people and the untapped potential on every corner.

I have deep roots in Limerick. I grew up on the North Circular Road in Limerick City. I went to Salesian’s Primary School and then Laurel Hill Coláiste. I was born here, as were all my family back to my great-grandparents.

In fact, both my grandfather and great grandfather were mayors of Limerick. The story of my great grandfather, Michael J Keyes, is one that resonates with me. Although it is probably forgotten to living memory, Keyes Park in Southill was named for him, in honour of his representation of the workers of Limerick. I want to continue this tradition of representing Limerick people politically, especially workers and carers and people with disabilities who have been routinely treated with contempt, as demonstrated most recently in the referendum. As a worker, a parent and a person living with MS, I know we need a voice.

I am looking forward to this first ever, directly elected mayor campaign, Not least as one of our party’s first electoral candidates, but also to have the opportunity to put forward our party’s ideas to two hundred thousand workers and carers in Limerick. The foundation of our political ideas is that workers and carers can, and should, have more say in their homes, workplaces, communities and in the political system. We need ideas that take us off the autopilot course we have been on for so long; concrete proposals that empower people and improve everyday life for all.

When I say “we”, I mean all those who work, care or are cared for, nationally and in Limerick.

The Mayoral position has been created in the expectation that it will reinforce the status quo. I am standing for Mayor of Limerick, to challenge that assumption. I am also here to challenge the idea that there is something not serious about the mayoral role. To me, it is a position that can be used for social purpose and positive change. The challenge is to utilise the levers the mayor has been given, both statutorily and as a political broker with the national level. I want to use the position created by legislation earlier this year to advance a mayoral programme that grapples with the real problems faced by the people of Limerick.

The list is long. The state of housing, infrastructure and health services in Limerick are costing lives. The way to address crises whether at the level of Limerick hospital or the climate emergency is to put workers and carers and the least protected, first.

Limerick has serious public health problems with water and air quality, these flow from austerity and the housing crisis, and require coordinated responses across the local and national levels. Responses that I can broker as your Mayor.

As a public health scientist I possess skills in problem solving and decision making. But also, crucially, in collaborative work with ordinary people to platform their voices in tackling issues that impact their lives. Not using people or communities as one-time consultants. Not using consultation as lip-service. Instead, my whole vision and practice involves putting the affected people at the heart of planning, from start to finish.

The voices of environmentalists and biodiversity advocates are also too often marginalised and ignored. We need to hear from the people who understand our land: farmers, ecologists, conservationists. We need to meaningfully move towards local and global food security. The energy transition away from fossil fuels towards renewables needs to benefit ordinary people and not just line the pockets of international investors.

My campaign will actively seek input from workers, carers, those who are cared for. Especially from a community of which I am a member, people with disabilities.

During the campaign, I will be taking my proposals across Limerick for people to engage freely to develop a mayoral programme for all. If elected I can recruit and work with councillors in a joined-up way that supports people-driven planning and development.

With this election of Ireland’s first Directly Elected Mayor, we stand at a pivotal moment in Limerick’s history where bold, progressive leadership and innovative solutions are needed to address the pressing issues we face.

My mayoral programme currently has five central themes, but it is also a set of proposals for transformative change. The five central themes are: Accessibility for all. Transparent governance, open democracy. Social Justice. Housing, education, health care for all. And. Climate Action for the Benefit of all. That repetition of “for all” is a statement in and of itself. Limerick should be for everyone.

My mayoral programme will be firmly within the statutory capabilities and operational capacities of the mayor and the Council. I am looking forward to talking about these proposals with the people of Limerick. As a disabled person I know that limitations are there to be overcome. Together we can surpass expectations for this role and Limerick.

If elected as your Mayor, I commit to prioritising transparency and accountability. Accessibility will underpin all actions and plans. If you design for the least able, everybody benefits. I envisage a Limerick where housing isn’t a constant worry, our hospital functions as it should and our economy thrives. A Limerick where sustainability is not just a buzzword but a way of life. A Limerick that faces up to the realities of the climate crisis. A Limerick where diversity is cherished as a source of strength and enrichment.

I cannot achieve this vision alone. We need to work hand in hand to co-create a brighter future for ourselves and generations to come. I am ready to lead. With your support and trust I am confident that we can make Limerick the shining beacon of progress and prosperity that she deserves to be.
